cats go meow meow
They have cute paws
When they get angry
They bring out their claws

cats play with toys
They make lots of noise...
cats are white
they like to fight

kittens sleep soundly,
they have cute noses,

They scare rats away,
All night all day

Lots of lines about tigers...

Some lines about ocelots...

More lines of the cat poem... ;-)
